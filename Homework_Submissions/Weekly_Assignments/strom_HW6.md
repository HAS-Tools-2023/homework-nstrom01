# Week 6 Forecast - Method and Summary
### * To view the data in a coherent layout, view through the text editor interface and not through Preview * 

- I made this forecast by using pandas functions for the following methods. First, I found the average of the past two weeks (September 27 - October 6) of the daily flow values. Next I created a pandas df with an avg of the same chunk of dates for each year of the historical flow data all the way back to 1989. With the df of historical averaged flow values, I identified  all years that had a flow that was within +/- 40% of the average flow found for the 2023 Sep27-Oct6 average. 

- I used this list of years to find the histroical average from this chunk for the flow in the 1 week out time frame from todays submission and the historical average of the 2 week out time frame and used these values as my prediction for flow.

- My rationale for doing this method is I assume that weeks that have similar weather patterns in the timeframe leading up to the date of analysis will possibly have similar weather patterns in the proceeding week. Now that I am thinking further about this, I could have checked the standard deviations across the weeks historically to see if this assumption is valid... perhaps next time. 
  
- The range of 40% within the average calculated for 2023 may have been too large, however, not many years seemed to have similar averages, only 9 years out of the 34 years had averages that were in this range, about 25%. Perhaps I should have chosen a smaller range for more accuracy?
