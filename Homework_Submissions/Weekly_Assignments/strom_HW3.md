- This assignment was hard for a lot of people. We'll discuss more this week when I'm back. Hopefully you are feeling more on track after assignment 4. 

- Also please make sure to add a header and some more formatting for your markdown file to make it easier to read. I'll also talk about this in class on Tuesday.

# Week 3 Forecast explanation
The forecast using python this week was a bit confusing and difficult for me. I was able to run some of the commands, but it took a few hours of messing around to realize I was getting nowhere and I started to run out of time. 

I had some errors running the initial copy pasted code given on GitHub and realized I need to remove some of the heading from the original data downloaded for the code to run properly. 

I am realizing from this assignment that I need to go back and review the exercises for this week and go to the next office hours to inquire about how to approach this assignment. 
Unfortunately I waited for the weeked to do this assignment when I cannot go into office hours. Next assignment I will start sooner. 

I included a bit of the code I wrote, there was alot more code written, but it ended up not functioning and yielding errors so that has been deleted and not included. Unfortunately I ran out of time trying to use Python so I reverted to excel last minute to at least enter a submission. I think I really need to practice and review the content. 

Flow, year, month, and day are all lists. They contain numerical values so int. They are the length of the integers contained in the files. The lenght yielded is 12668 from the python functions. 

I tried to run the functions in python for the following listed questions but could not figure them out and kept getting back values that did not seem correct.
