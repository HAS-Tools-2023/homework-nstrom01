3/3 - Nice work. It is definitely a lot of learning curves at once but hopefully it will start clicking as we keep going.

I created my 1 week and 2 week out forecast for this week by using excel. For both of the weekly forecasts, I took the average of the historical data for the time periods between 09/03-09/09 for 1 week out and 09/10-09/16 for 2 weeks out for the years 2022-2015. I then average the values obtained from each corresponding week time frame across the years 2015-2022 and obtained a prediction that is based upon the historical data. 
I speculate this will not be an accurate approach, and using excel, I felt limited with my capabilities and the functions I could perform onto the data.  

The parts of the class that are confusing me is that I am installing, running, and utilizing a lot of new programs and interfaces all at once. Since I am not familiar with this type of user interface, I am basically relying on trust that everything I am running and instialling is working and collaborating together correctly. Itt is hard to feel like I understand most of what is going on because it is all so new. This is what I expected of learning this material, and it is probably a good thing because I am learning a new interface and way to work with data that I probably should have figured out years ago!
