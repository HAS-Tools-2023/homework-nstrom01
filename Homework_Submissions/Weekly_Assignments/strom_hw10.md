# Week 10 Assignment 

Write a short markdown reflecting on (1) What you learned, (2) things you still find confusing or couldn't solve.

## What has been learned

- I am more confident with building functions, and I can see the very useful power of building functions. I am further seeing the advantage of building functions that are more generic, and can take a wider range of inputs rather than being specifically hardcoded. This was a good exercise to practice putting all the piecs together from the past few weeks. What I have mostly learned is how to connect everything together. 

## What is still confusing / difficult to solve??? 

- The challenge in class where we write a loop within the function, then a function that processes through a loop on the outside was confusing at first, but after looking and thinking about it, it was not as bad. There are some videos on youtube going over simple loops and the gist of the process, and I think these helped me.
