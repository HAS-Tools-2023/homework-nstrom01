# WEEK 13 Reflection  

## Changes Made on Submitted Code
I made the following changes on this weeks code from the last version
- Style & Readability: I adhered to PEP8 style guide on this version. I used a linter and ensured specific things such as character line length, spacing, and indentation were followed. This helped readability, however some of the linter suggestions seemed a bit unnecessary as in they did not seem to improve readability, but I followed them for good practice. 
- Use of Functions: I used 4 functions in this code, 1 main function with 3 embedded functions. This was done for efficiency and reduction of code. This was a useful approach, however there are restrictions as it is more difficult to write a function within the function and test-run it's capabilities. 
- Flow: I improved the flow of this code from the last. I tried to define variables that would be repeatively used, and reduce the amount of variables created. I have a habit of creating many variables and this can get confusing and excessive. There seems to be an art to knowing when it is best to create a variable or embed a procedure into a code. Sometimes adding variables can help for readability and comprehension, but too many can reduce readablity. 
  

## Areas for Improvement on code
- Defining function variables: I realized toward the end of my code that you do not need to define inputs for embedded functions (functiosn w/ in functions). Rather you can just use variables defined prior to the function, granted they were defined within the main funciton. Therefore, I could have reduced code by doing this, and it is much more concise using prior defined variables, than taking a variable and solely renaming it. 
- Conciseness: Despite my flow of code improving, I think I could improve the conciseness. Perhaps I could use loops instead of functions, however I am better with writing functions. My outline and structure of code could have been writen more concise, but it seems that many of these realizations in efficiency are seen towards the end of the code when I am finishing, and changing certain approaches could mean scraping much of the code. I am sure I will get better at this with more practice and experience. 


## chatGPT
- I did not use chatGPT very much for this code. I used it here and there to solve some smaller issues of a few lines, and did this before seeing the instructions that said to post a pre chatGPT draft. I used it mostly for issues when I could not figure out why my linter was mad at me, and it usually came down to a very subtle spacing or indentation issue.
- I think chatGPT can be helpful for specific problems, and smaller lines of codes, but not when it comes to larger structuring, or more complex interconnected code areas. For curosity, I copy pasted my final code into chatGPT to see if it could be improved, and while the organization improved very much, it would not run properly, so I kept my mostly chatGPTless code for submission.
