# Week 5 Assignment: NStrom
## Forecast 
- I will use my free pass that I received from winning the forecast prediction last week. 

- To be honest, when I heard we can use any method for the streamflow prediction last week, I thought that meant any method including guessing and intuition, so my prediction from this week was from looking at the data visually.

- If you would like, I can go back and write a script for the prediction of last weeks streamflow. I apologize!

## Weekly Reflection
- This week has gone pretty well. Taking the week to catch up definitely did help. Loops are still challenging to me but I think it will just take practice and experience observing how they operate. I have made a few faulty loops this past week where the code keeps reiterating until I cancel the operation, so there is definitely some skills to learn yet. 
  
- The loop exercise done in class was very helpful to get a better conceptual understanding. 
  
- At this point, what has been very helpful is reading reviewing completed or semi completed coding projects and seeing methods that one would take to approach. Starting from scratch code is still difficult for me.
  
- The Assignment was a challenge for me, but appopriately challenging and it felt like it helped me develope my coding skills. 
  
- The very last part of the assignment, which involved printing the average of each months daily flow with the corresponding month was a challenge that I did consult another student on to get some hints/direction. It would have been difficult to complete that last section solely on my own. While I would like to come to my own completely original solution, sometimes when you have spent a bit too much time being stuck on a speicifc piece of code and you are starting to get frusturated and you dont have all the time in the world (unfortunately), a better approach is to seek out some help and if you can find a solution, try to completely understand their approach and be able to recreate it without referencing their code.
